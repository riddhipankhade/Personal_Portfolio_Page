    <h2>Passions And Interests</h2>
    <p>I have a deep curiosity about how code works and its principles.As i started out to explore about diffrent languages and trying them out, I am slowly relising which language I should persue as my 
       carrier, though I'm still in the process of exploration, which is perfectly okay.As far as coding is concerned I am currently focused on mastering front-end WebDev for this year. I'm immersing myself in the complexities of creating engaging user interfaces and seamless user experiences.
    </p>
       <p>Apart from coding i also have interest in drawing and playing basketball from time to time.Take them as my hobbies! I mostly do these hobbies when i want to get some laod off of my head.Works evertime:)

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>I'm still in the process of discovering myself, so claiming to know myself well would be a stretch. However, one thing I'm certain of is that I'm a determined student and a committed learner, so you can trust me on that. If you're curious to learn more about me and my personality, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always open to connecting and sharing more about who I am.
